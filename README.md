# SharePoint-Site-Update
This PowerShell script demonstrates some simple handling of updating SharePoint site scripts and site designs. With this script (adjusted to your needs), it is much easier to simply update the site script file, then run the PowerShell script again.

To customize for your use:
1. Update the tenant domain
2. Update the title and description of the site script and design
3. Change WebTemplate on the site design to 68 if this design is for communication sites instead of team sites
